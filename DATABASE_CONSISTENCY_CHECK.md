## 🎯 METHODS CONSISTENCY

### Static Methods Pattern ✅

All static methods follow consistent patterns:

- ✅ `createX(data)` - Creation methods
- ✅ `getX(id, options)` - Retrieval with pagination
- ✅ `isX(id)` - Boolean checks
- ✅ `updateX(id, data)` - Updates
- ✅ Error handling with meaningful messages
- ✅ Options support (limit, skip, filters)

### Instance Methods Pattern ✅

- ✅ Naming: camelCase verbs (e.g., `updateBadge()`, `canCreatePost()`)
- ✅ Return types: Object với `{allowed, reason}` cho validation methods
- ✅ Async where needed (database operations)
- ✅ Side effects clearly documented

### Hooks Pattern ✅

**Pre-save hooks:**

- ✅ User: Hash password
- ✅ Category: Generate slug from name
- ✅ Post: Generate slug from title, update score
- ✅ Comment: Update score
- ✅ UserFollow: Validate không tự follow

**Post-save hooks:**

- ✅ UserFollow: Create notification, update counts
- ✅ CategoryFollow: Update category followersCount
- ✅ DirectMessage: Update conversation, create notifications (batch)

**Post-delete hooks:**

- ✅ UserFollow: Giảm counts
- ✅ CategoryFollow: Giảm category followersCount

- ✅ Polymorphic refs use `refPath` correctly (Vote, Report, Notification, AdminLog)

### Unique Constraints ✅

- ✅ User: username, email, googleId
- ✅ Category: name, slug
- ✅ Post: slug
- ✅ Vote: (user, targetType, targetId)
- ✅ Report: (reporter, targetType, targetId)
